to say J'RethsRoomDesc:
	say "     While J'Reth seems to be living in a storage closet at the back of a gaming store that is now filled with sleeping bags and mattresses, it is large enough for a bed, a desk, and several rows of shelves. The shelves are covered in tabletop models such as trolls, dragons, and wolves, rulebooks for assorted games, and small pots of paint. Considering what you know about J'Reth, the room seems to suit him very well. On the desk pushed into the corner against the wall is a computer but it doesn't appear to be plugged in so you doubt that the draco-mantis has used it recently. The walls are covered in promotional posters for various movies and games, colorful pins holding them in place.";

to say J'RethTalk1: [Hobbies]
	say "     You enquire about what J'Reth's hobbies are, earning a pleased smile in return. 'I'm glad that you asked. If you look around, you'll see all the miniatures from assorted tabletop role-playing games as well as my collection of rulebooks, bestiaries, tomes of lore, dice, pens, pencils... I'm going overboard, aren't I?' He gives a sheepish grin, but you wave your hand dismissively. You did ask, and his enthusiasm is admirable. 'I've been playing Kastles & Kobolds for a few years, so each time they release an expansion, I sort of feel like I need to get it. And I know what you're thinking, but it isn't just kobolds. There are lots of different races that you can be. Elves of various alignments, dwarves, elementals, beastfolk... there are lots. Sorry if I'm a little defensive. I was teased about it when I was younger.' You nod in understanding as you pick up a model of what looks like a troll from the shelf, angling it in the limited light to have a look at the finer details.";
	say "     'If you're looking to see if it is anatomically correct then I'm sorry that I must disappoint you. They aren't. I checked when I first got them,' J'Reth informs you, and you grin at him as, realizing what he has said, a blush spreads across his features. You hear him mumble, 'I really need to learn to keep my mouth shut sometimes.' In an effort to shift the conversation from the disgraceful lack of genitals on his troll, the draco-mantis continues explaining his other hobbies. 'While the shortage of electricity in the city currently prevents it, I also liked playing video games. I wouldn't say that I was particularly amazing, but I got to the point that the people that I regularly played things with over the internet weren't always complaining and I even got a few compliments. I'm not sure whether to hope that the rest of the world is aware what is happening in the city or that the military has managed to keep it secret. On the one hand, I don't want my friends to think that I am avoiding them, but equally, I don't want them to be worried about me.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'I doubt that the world is ignorant of what is happening here. There was a lot of time for people to call for help or warn people on the internet before we were cut off...' J'Reth falls silent for a moment, seemingly musing on his words. ' Sorry, we were talking about video games, weren't we? There were only a few multiplayer-focused games that I played. I mostly did single player RPGs like the Ancient Tomes series. The older ones were good, but the character customization in the later ones really allowed me to immerse myself. Not looking like I had a box for a head was definitely a bonus. Unfortunately, with the current power problem, I haven't been able to play since the outbreak as, you know, computers need electricity. At least I still have Kastles and Kobolds, but that is more fun with friends. I don't suppose you have any other friends that might be interested. I'd be happy to GM.' While you can't think of anyone at the moment, you agree to mention it to some of the people that you know just in case.";
	say "     'Thanks, that means a lot. Ummm what else... Oh! I don't know how I forgot, but I'm also a huge fan of (Backpackemon?), the creature collecting game. I know that you're meant to battle, but I found the collecting and spending time with them to be much more fulfilling. Why would anyone want to hurt such adorable little monsters? I sort of look like my favorite one of them now, my favorite to be honest, so whatever it is that has caused this does have some benefits despite all the destruction that it has wrought. I suppose that you could say that I like watching movies too, but it isn't in the same league as KnK or gaming. Why is it when someone asks you what you enjoy doing you always sound boring or like a geek?' Considering that he has shared quite a bit about his hobbies, you reassure him that it is enough for now and thank him for telling you a bit about himself.";

to say J'RethTalk2: [Before the Outbreak]
	say "     Curious as to what J'Reth did before the nanite apocalypse, you ask him to tell you. 'Hmmm, yes I suppose life then was quite different to what it is now,' the draco-mantis muses. 'As you can see around you, I'm rather into video games, Kastles & Kobolds, and those sorts of geeky things, so I was going to study game design at the college here. I'd heard that the course at Tenvale was particularly good and that having a degree in it was respected by the majority of game companies so I would have better employment prospects. Unfortunately, I left the paperwork for applying perhaps a little later than I should have, and the outbreak of creatures and transformations happened before I finished it. I wouldn't be able to get it now. I was living with my parents outside the city, so beyond the military containment zone. At least they are probably alright, but they are likely concerned about me.'";
	say "     'I know that there is a stigma attached to living with your parents as you get older, but it saved costs, they genuinely cared about me, and it was convenient for being able to come into the city but avoid some of the other aspects of city life such as crowding and dark alleys from which muggers might get you. I had enough problems with bullies extorting me for money at school. I didn't want to have to deal with that any more as an adult. Though with the blades that I now have on my arms, I don't think that would be a problem anymore, not that I would be able to bring myself to hurt somebody with them. I mainly like them because they look cool. But returning to discussing my living arrangements, as long as I helped around the house by mowing the lawn, occasionally assisting Dad at weekends, and generally earning my place, I wasn't expected to pay rent. My parents weren't too demanding, primarily focused on making sure that I understood responsibility rather than expecting money from me which they knew I would want for college.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Which brings me to the reason I was in the city when everything went wrong. As I'm sure you are aware, college is expensive, and I needed to have money to pay for the various fees. I'd managed to get work at an automotive factory so that I could start to save up and reduce the eventual student debt that I knew I would end up with. Five days a week from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon I would take a bus from near home into the city and slave away in the factory. I suppose that it could have been worse, but when it was more of a means for me to study game design, it did feel demoralizing at times. I'm unlikely to even get into college now so all that hard work was for nothing more than the harsh life lesson of [']life isn't fair[']. Maybe I'm being pessimistic, the infected may yet be allowed to reintegrate into society and I'll be able to follow my dreams.'";
	say "     'Anyway, I was on my way to work when the driver shouted about something in the road and crashed the bus into some parked cars. I was more shocked than hurt but some of the other passengers were injured, and it didn't take long for them to start transforming. It was rather terrifying, as I'm sure you can imagine, and as I escaped from the bus, I must have cut myself on some metal or something because I started turning green. I admit that I panicked and ran, roars and growls echoing from the streets around us. For the first few days, I hid a lot of the time, but eventually I found myself outside the mall and was invited to take shelter here as long as I behaved myself. I don't seem to have become as feral as many around the city so this has been an agreeable arrangement. That's the brief explanation of me before and at the outbreak, any more questions?' Despite this offer, you get the impression that talking about this has been harder on him than he is likely to admit, and you shake your head, thanking him for sharing his story with you.";

to say J'RethTalk3: [Small Talk]
	say "     [One of]'I considered being an adventurer like you, but I didn't want to take an arrow to the knee. Or, for that matter, to have some mindless beast bend me over a park bench and have their way with me[or]'I'm sorry, but your princess is in another castle. Or prince, whichever you prefer. I don't judge, especially with the current state of the city. Sexual discrimination seems diminished from what it used to be[or]'I'm surprised at how little caution people seem to have for food since the outbreak of whatever this is. Food that has been lying around for weeks could be infectious or at least spoiled and poisonous. I've even heard of infections that turn people into food-based creatures. You can never trust the cake-people. They always lie[or]'This city is inhabited by creatures of many different types. For some people, these creatures are pets. Others fight them. Myself... I try to stay where it is safe. Now tell me, are you a boy or a girl? I already know the answer, but I didn't want to miss a chance at making another game reference[at random].' He seems enthusiastic about what he is talking about, even if you don't understand some of what he is talking about. You both relax into idle discussions about the weather, shops that you used to like, and some of the creatures that you think are impressive. After a few minutes, your conversation comes to a comfortable end, and you decide what to do next while J'Reth futilely attempts to brush some magazines into a tidier pile.";

Laughter, chatter, and just general hubbub shows just how normal life can still be despite the effects of the nanites. Feeling a little peckish, you begin to approach the counter but accidentally bump against someone's side, causing them to drop their tray of food. With a shout of surprise, steaming soup splatters over their clothes and on the floor, the plastic bowl clattering mockingly beside their feet. You begin to apologize, but upon seeing them, the words halt in your throat. Their appearance is unlike any you have seen before. Their frame is somewhat slight, though they are not completely devoid of muscles, making you wonder what gender they are. Through their t-shirt that is rapidly becoming transparent, you can see that the same green scales that cover their face are present on the rest of their body, while darker-green chitinous plates appear to be a form of natural armor in places around their chest, forearms, thighs, and shins. You realize just how much you aren't paying attention to your surroundings when you spot the wings sprouting from their back, similar to those on a praying mantis.";
	say "     A voice interrupts you, sarcastically commenting, 'You bumped into me, yet you seem to be the one in shock. Perhaps stop staring and finish apologizing or cleaning up your mess.' You realize that the Draco-Mantis in front of you is the one who spoke, and he's looking at you expectantly from behind some spectacles, his face just as androgynous as the rest of him, with piercing blue eyes. You bashfully continue saying sorry, offering him a hand, only to be met with a rather sharp looking blade that extends from the chitinous guards on his forearm. 'Careful. I'm sure it was only an accident, so I don't need to take a pound of flesh. Also, I don't want to risk contracting ";

That said, I should really get these clothes off. No, you can't come with me. You can apologize at another time. I'm usually somewhere around the mall. It's not as if there is anywhere else that is safe.' With that, he places his tray on a nearby table and hurries off, likely to a clothes shop or laundromat. You surreptitiously leave too, no longer feeling like eating here and not wanting to have a run-in with the cleaners or security.";

There doesn't seem to be any lights, so you keep one hand on the wall, waiting for your eyes to acclimate to the darkness. Suddenly, your hand runs over something that doesn't seem to be the wall. 'Can I help you?' you hear a voice say. 'Give me a minute, there should be a flashlight on the ground by my feet.' You back off a few paces apologizing while whoever you touched pats the concrete for their torch. 'Hang on. I'm sure I recognize that voice.' With a click, there is light, and you are staring at the familiar form of the Mantis Dragon. He doesn't seem to be wearing his shirt, or anything for that matter, though a quick glance at his crotch only shows a small slit in his carapace. You blink at each other before he breaks the silence. 'Were you checking for burns, or do you often feel up people you find in the dark?' he asks completely straight-faced, looking at you over the top of his glasses.'";
	say "     You protest that you couldn't possibly have known it was him in the dark and that you were just exploring a corridor that you hadn't seen before. He makes a skeptical sound before speaking. 'I don't believe that I introduced myself when we last met, what with the hot soup ruining my shirt, which I had to throw away because someone had contaminated my washing powder with a vitamin-rich substance. I'm J'Reth, and you owe me some new soup, preferably from a can as I don't feel I can show my face in the food court for a bit. One of the lunch-ladies made a joke about me not needing a knife with my food, and a few people may have found it funny. Possibly more than a few.' He lifts his arms, directing your attention towards the sharp blades growing from them. 'As if I could use these for cutting food. Though she did look slightly sorry at causing so much amusement at my expense, so I don't hold it against her. Accidents happen and comments can have unintended consequences. We just have to accept the mistake and move on.'";

Come on, I'll walk back with you, as long as you don't spill any more soup on me, as I can't exactly molt on command, and I don't want stains on my carapace.' You give him a dry glance as you begin to walk back the way you came, the Draco-Mantis not far behind you. 'Don't give me that look. I've met you twice, and you started today's conversation by being handsy in the dark. You're lucky that I'm flattered rather than finding it creepy. You perv.' This last comment is muttered under his breath, and you pretend not to have heard it as you break out of the dark corridor, back into the activity of the food court. Coming out behind you, he looks around for a moment before quietly mumbling to himself, 'I feel quite liberated without my clothes, and no one has taken issue with it. Something to consider in the future, J'Reth.' You raise an eyebrow at him, and he blushes slightly.";
	say "     'Stop listening to my conversations with myself, would you? It's a habit I have, and I don't plan on losing it any time soon, but some of my musings are for my ears only.' Despite this outburst, you get the impression that he is enjoying the company. Remembering that you still haven't apologized properly for spilling soup on him or feeling his firm chest in the dark and now listening to him talking to himself, you take the chance to say sorry without having to hurry. 'That's very kind of you, but just to be on the safe side, I would like you to prove that you really are sincere. You can't be too careful these days with how the city has become, and I want to be sure that you haven't got too nefarious of an ulterior motive. Bring me a tin of soup, tomato if you can, and I'll call it even. You seem nice, and I haven't got many friends at the moment, talking to myself being a prime symptom of this. When you have what I want, I'll be in the [bold type]Food Court[roman type] probably.' Giving you a hasty but hopeful farewell, J'Reth hurries through the crowd, a multitude of eyes gazing admiringly at his body. It shouldn't be too hard to find a tin of soup, and he seems nice enough you think to yourself as you decide what to do next.";

The shelves have been pushed round to give a modicum of privacy in one corner with a sign requesting that passersby be quiet so as not to disturb anyone who is currently asleep. You can see what looks like a door to the storeroom at the back, but between it and you are a sea of mattresses and sleeping bags, suggesting that there are too many refugees to house in the shelved-off area and that people will take whatever space they can get. Cautiously creeping across the room, focusing on not treading on any sleeping bodies, you finally reach the door and silently slip through, closing it behind you.

Small spurts of pre coat your hand and aiding in lubrication as it gets smeared over all eleven inches of his length. 'This means a lot to me, so thank you,' he gasps, the sensations that you are causing him affecting his speech. J'Reth's body echoes his gratitude, his shaft throbbing in your hand, pulsing in your grasp and begging for you to continue your attentions.

You decide that you have teased him for long enough and begin to take a more active role in pleasuring him, bobbing your head back and forth while sealing your lips around his shaft, causing him to half-stifle a moan. Gazing up at him and meeting his eyes, you continue your treatment of him, eagerly devouring more and more of his cock with each push, the tip reaching increasingly further down your throat until you reach your limit. By now, his knot has become more pronounced, and you doubt that he will last much longer before he climaxes and fills your stomach.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'You... mmmn... really seem to... mmmn... know what you are doing,' J'Reth exclaims between moans as he braces the back of your head with his hands while thrusting with ever increasing desperation, racing towards orgasm. Who knew that splashing soup on a stranger could lead to this? While he definitely isn't going to get the knot in, that doesn't stop him from trying to slip more of his shaft into your mouth with each frantic thrust, his body beginning to shudder as it approaches the cresting moment just before climax. With a euphoric cry, the Draco-Mantis begins to shoot his cum down your throat, hilting himself as the first squirt sprays forth. His length pulses, swelling and contracting in the tight, warm walls of your esophagus and filling your stomach with his carnal fluids. It doesn't show any signs of abating, making you wonder just how efficient his balls are, especially when you can't see them.";
			say "     J'Reth begins to slowly slide his still orgasming cock from inside of you, gasping at the sensations from his tender flesh. As the tip finally slips from the confines of your throat and rests on your tongue, you get the full flavor of his semen. While his precum was merely sweet, the cum that has so convincingly filled your stomach is similar in taste to honey, lacking the sometimes bitter or salty flavors more common in humans. He allows you a chance to take advantage of this, holding his cock inside of your mouth as the jets of sperm gradually fade to a trickle. 'That was certainly an experience worth repeating,' J'Reth says between deep breaths while his shaft softens and slips from your maw, dripping excess fluid onto the floor between you. 'Though I will have to return the favor at some point. My apologies that it can't be now, but after that, I am really exhausted.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "You can hardly blame him, since it feels like you have several liters of semen sloshing around inside of your stomach, so you stagger to your feet again while he smiles tiredly, but gratefully, at you. Remembering your original reason for coming here, you quickly find the tin of tomato soup in your bag and toss it onto the bed beside him. 'Shouldn't it be me paying you for that, or did you enjoy it that much?' J'Reth teases you as he stows it on a small table at the head of the bed. Lying down on his bed, the Draco-Mantis sighs, 'I'm going to have a little lie down if you don't mind. As well as draining me of cum, you also drained me of energy, and a nap seems like a good way of replenishing both. I'll see you in the food court when I can, but you can consider your apology accepted.' You wish him sweet dreams before quietly leaving the room again and making your way back to the main area of the mall.";

It doesn't take you long to reach the toy store again, remembering the way from last time, and you see the Draco-Mantis slouched against a wall outside. He looks up as you approach, a grin spreading across his face. 'Hey, how are you?' he asks, straightening up and walking over to meet you. 'It's good to see you again. The tin of soup you left was delicious, though I [if resolution of Soup & Sexual Gratification is 1]believe that I especially enjoyed the extra attentions beforehand.

Barely hesitating, you follow him. Having been preoccupied the last time you were in here, you hadn't taken in what his room looked like. About 6 meters long and 3 meters wide, it feels quite spacious even with the bed against one poster-covered wall and the shelves almost sagging under the weight of books and figurines of monsters. 'I take it that you didn't look around when you were delivering the soup,' J'Reth queries, looking proudly over his collection. You shake your head and continue looking at them almost in awe until the draco-mantis sits on his bed and pats the duvet for you to seat yourself beside him. The mattress is soft beneath you, and you wonder how he got his own room with the number of refugees sleeping just outside the door. 'Before I go any further, I must ask, are you happy for me to [if resolution of Soup & Sexual Gratification is 1]return the favor from last time[else]pleasure you in thanks for all that you've done[end if], or would you prefer to bask in the glory of my collection?";

Now if you could just scooch to the edge a bit more, I'll get to work on sucking you off. With a tongue as long as mine, I should be able to give quite the exotic experience.'

At first, his tongue's penetration stings, making you wonder whether this is a good idea, but it soon dulls, being replaced by a feeling of tightness as more and more of his tongue squeezes through the narrow entrance.

His ravenous conquest leaves you unable to muster anything but soft, pleasured panting as he seeks out your most sensitive spots and attacks them all at once. Not content to simply lather your opening, that salivating maw continues to wetly suckle your shaft, your crown kissing the back of his throat as he services you inside and out.";

Tapping him on the back of the head to signal your impending orgasm, you are surprised when he pushes his face flush with your crotch and awaits your climax, tongue still pistoning back and forth inside of your urethra. As you crest, you grip the spikes on the sides of his head, pulling his face down while grinding up against his features. The white hot rush of your orgasm leaves you trembling and bucking erratically, your cum under pressure from the obstruction of his tongue, which only seems to prolong your climax. What isn't refluxed into your churning balls gushes out around the edges, sloppily filling his maw in strained, squirting spurts.

Sensing your readiness, he begins to withdraw the limber length of muscle, a languid motion that smears his saliva over your well-stretched inner flesh. Before long, the tip flits free with a final sputter of cum, leaving your seed to trickle steadily down your pulsing mast. You can't help but reach down to trace around the opening, relishing the sensitivity that permeates your flesh while basking in the warmth of your post-orgasmic haze.

At times, his tongue is moving in opposition to his lips, sliding up your length as your shaft is engulfed in the wet warmth of his maw. Then at a whim, it will move in tandem instead, slithering towards the base as he swallows your cock. His oral ministrations have sighs and gasps spilling from your mouth, and your limbs occasionally twitch, seemingly unsure whether to let you relax or prepare for the next burst of stimulation.

The result of this is a skewed smirk and a steady stream of saliva drooling from the corner of his mouth to splatter on his thigh, misted by the copious precum that you seem to be producing. He hurriedly seals his mouth again, a mirthful glint in his eye as he returns to servicing you, the fluid trickling off his leg to pool on the floor.

Doubting that your endurance will last much longer, you begin to hammer into his maw, taking complete control over your impending completion. The draco-mantis seems content with this, merely extending his tongue over his bottom lip to ensure ease of entry and comfort. As you crest, you grip the spikes on the sides of his head, pulling his face down while grinding up against his features. The white hot rush of your orgasm leaves you trembling and bucking erratically, cum splattering the walls of his mouth and throat.

'If you're going to fall asleep, at least scooch over so that I can fit beside you. I don't want to miss my chance at some post-coital cuddling.'

If you do nod off, I have an errand that I've been asked to do, so I may not be around when you wake up. Don't hesitate to drop by again in future though. I swear we'll be able to have a proper conversation next time. Only if you want to though. No pressure.'

'I'm not sure whether to feel that I am being too forward or whether I would be considered slow,' J'Reth muses as his hands circle ever closer to your featureless groin. 'Maybe a bit of both. Slow for in the streets, but way faster than how the world used to be. All that matters is that I care for you and that you care for me,' he says, earnestly looking you in the face, though his hands continue to roam over your body[if player is not naked], stripping you as they go[end if].";
			say "     'Give me a minute to undress. I want to be able to feel you against my body and also don't want to spoil my clothes should I get too excited.' While he carefully maneuvers his wings out of his t-shirt and pulls his trousers over his feet, you gaze about the room at the posters for several popular films along with a few that you haven't heard of. As you turn back again, you are surprised when you find J'Reth locking your lips with his own and a long dexterous tongue tickling the back of your teeth. After a heated moment, he breaks the kiss, almost panting, 'Mmmmm, that's the sort of thing I could look forward to. Would you mind rolling over please? I wish to cuddle with you, and with my wings, I think that I am better being the one on the edge. After that, I thought that I might explore your depths with my tongue. With a tongue as long as mine, I should be able to give quite the exotic experience. Sound good?' An enticing offer if there ever was one, you lie with your back to the wall, giving him room to settle beside you face to face.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     He only gazes into your eyes for a few seconds before his lips meet with your own, and his hands start to rove across your exposed flesh, squeezing where it is soft and caressing where you are firmer. While at first you are apprehensive at the scythe-like blades jutting from his arms, J'Reth uses them with proficiency, grazing across your skin to heighten your excitement as they stimulate you in such a contrasting manner to his fingers. Not once does he draw blood, and you eventually relax against him again as you feel the sensations over your waist, back, and [if legsname of player is not listed in infections of SerpentineList and legsname of player is not listed in infections of SlidingList]thighs[else]shoulders[end if]. 'Now that I've prepared you, it's time for my wet... limber... adventurous tongue to slide its way into your ass.' J'Reth punctuates each word of his description with a kiss and a lick, on chest, tummy, and finally your crotch. He slips from the bed to kneel upon the floor, before carefully turning you around and maneuvering you to the edge.";
			say "     The first contact of his tongue against your twitching sphincter startles you, leaving a dampness as the dextrous organ slithers across your exposed flesh before returning to the waiting hole. You prepare yourself knowing what is coming, almost quivering in anticipation. A steady pressure builds before J'Reth's tongue squeezes into your anus and commences with slathering your walls with saliva, easing the passage of an increasing amount of the limber muscle as it delves deeper, folding and twirling to heighten your pleasure. Not content to only stimulate you internally, the draco-mantis presses his muzzle against your backside, the air from his nostrils tickling your skin as he inhales and exhales. Soft squelching sounds leak from where he is pleasuring you, the excess saliva dribbling from your anus and past his lips before puddling on the sheets.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You also hear a quiet slapping noise and guess that J'Reth is masturbating with one hand even as the other spreads the curve of your ass to allow unimpeded access to your hole for his greedy maw. Had he not been clear that this was in thanks for all your work and thus all about you, you might try and aid him in his gratification, but instead, you lie there and hope that your gentle moans at his skilful rimming and penetration will help goad him to a satisfactory release. The writhing and pulsing of the organ inside of you draws you closer to orgasm, and you increase the force with which you grind against his face each time his tongue stimulates a particularly sensitive bundle of nerves, drawing a groan of contentment from his busy maw. As the rush overwhelms you, you reach back and grip the spikes on the sides of his head, pulling his face even more firmly into your rear while rubbing over the contours of his face. The rush of your orgasm leaves you trembling and bucking erratically, the lack of fluid to expel not diminishing the magnitude with which you feel the waves of euphoria.";
			say "     As you climax, the sound of frantic slapping increases until you hear liquid splatter onto the floor with surprising force and a relieved sigh from your partner. By the time your shuddering subsides, your muscles feel slack, and an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion envelops you like a warm, soft blanket. J'Reth gives you a moment to rest, equally fatigued from his ministrations and orgasm, before slowly slithering his tongue from your spit-soaked anus. As the tip flicks out and back into his mouth, you roll over and give him a quick, intense kiss, tasting yourself on his breath. Gazing into his eyes, you find him staring back at you with a smoldering expression, saliva smeared around his jaw. You gently stroke the top of J'Reth's head, still recovering from your climax and still wanting to feel him against you. J'reth seems equally sated, a few errant beads of cum still clinging to the tip of his cock as it shrinks back into his crotch.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'That was definitely an experience worth repeating, wouldn't you agree?' the draco-mantis teases, circling his lips with his tongue before giving you a wink. 'Was it to your liking too?' Considering the intensity of the orgasm he gave you, you have to agree, nodding your head at him before slumping back to lie on the bed, staring at the ceiling. 'If you're going to fall asleep, at least scooch over so that I can fit beside you. I don't want to miss my chance at some post-coital cuddling.' You shuffle over and feel the draco-mantis recline beside you and embrace you. 'Mmmmm. Cozy. Just a warning though. If you do nod off, I have an errand that I've been asked to do, so I may not be around when you wake up. Don't hesitate to drop by again in future though. I swear that we'll be able to have a proper conversation next time. Only if you want to though. No pressure.' The two of you lie there until you fall asleep, J'Reth's firm body intimately curved around your own. You wake again to find him pulling his clothes back on and decide that you should probably be leaving too. When the both of you are ready, you leave the toy shop together before reluctantly parting to go about the rest of your day.";

		say "     Deciding that you would rather just sit and appreciate the amount of effort that must have gone into collecting so many posters, figurines, and other memorabilia, you tell J'Reth that for now you would prefer to just look around at his collection. 'I can understand that,' he laughs. 'It is quite considerable, and the size of the room makes it look all the more impressive. I realize that I'm a bit geeky, but I like what I like. Tabletop figures and scenery, posters from movies I enjoyed, collectibles from video games, and somewhere, I think that I even have some genuine movie props that my friends got me for my birthday a few years ago.' He falls silent for a few minutes, before continuing a little more reserved. 'I haven't seen them since the city fell apart. I just hope that they're alright and weren't one of the people who just dissolved. The sight of that was horrible.' He shudders, and you give him a quick reassuring hug.";
		say "     J'Reth leans against you and sighs, 'Thank you. If I can get through this, then so can they. There are good people out there as well as the ravening hordes,' he jokes, waving what looks like an orc figurine in his hand. You snort before agreeing. His collection really suits him. Wanting to return the subject to his hobby, the draco-mantis begins to show you some of the posters that he doesn't have up on the wall, instead having them rolled up in tubes. You enjoy this for about half an hour before J'Reth reluctantly comes to a stop. 'I have some errands that I have been asked to do, so I'm sorry that I'm going to have to go. I've really enjoyed being able to show off to you though, so feel free to come and see me again. Who knows, I may be able to convince you to play one of the games with me.' You decide that you should probably be leaving too, exiting the toy shop together before parting to go about the rest of your day.";

'I couldn't remember whether I had told you to come and visit me anytime that you wanted,' the draco-mantis breathlessly calls as he nears you. 'I may not always be there, but even if I'm not you can have a look at my collection while you wait for me as long as you are careful. Do you remember where I live? In the back of the toy store, just here.' he says, pointing to a conveniently placed map of the mall on a column beside the two of you. 'Sorry if I'm repeating myself, but I thought it better to tell you again just to make sure I wasn't sitting around waiting for someone who didn't know where to find me.' You have to agree with the logic and you find it cute just how much he seems to enjoys your company. 'Got to go again, I have a meeting with the representative of our area of the mall and I think I'm already going to be a couple of minutes late.' With that, he runs off again, leaving you to try and remember the directions to the toy store.";
